After installing the chart, view the status of the deployment by running the following commands.
It might take a few seconds, so rerun the commands until all of the components are running:

  kubectl get pods --namespace knative-serving
  kubectl get pods --namespace knative-eventing
  kubectl get pods --namespace knative-sources
